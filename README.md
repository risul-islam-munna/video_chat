# Testing Chat App using Socket.io, PeerJS, UUID, and Nodemon

This is a simple chat app built for testing purposes. It uses the Socket.io, PeerJS, UUID, and Nodemon libraries to enable real-time communication between multiple clients. The app is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and utilizes the Socket.io library to enable real-time, bidirectional, and event-based communication between the browser and the server.

## Features
- Real-time communication: The app allows users to communicate with each other in real-time through text messages.
- Easy to use: The app has a simple and intuitive user interface that makes it easy for users to navigate and communicate with each other.
- Scalable: The app uses Socket.io to enable real-time communication between multiple clients, making it easy to scale to handle a large number of users.

## Technologies Used
- Socket.io: A JavaScript library that enables real-time, bidirectional, and event-based communication between the browser and the server.
- PeerJS: A wrapper library that simplifies WebRTC peer-to-peer communication by providing an easy-to-use API.
- UUID: A library for generating unique identifiers that are used to identify users and sessions in the app.
- Nodemon: A tool that automatically restarts the app when changes are made, making it easy to develop and test the app.

## Requirements
- Web browser: The app requires a web browser to access the app.

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Run `npm install` to install the required dependencies.
3. Run `npm run devStart` to start the server.
4. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to access the app.

## Deployment
This app can be deployed to a web server or hosting service, such as Heroku, by following these steps:
1. Set the `PORT` environment variable to the desired port number.
2. Deploy the app to the server or hosting service using the appropriate method.
3. Access the app by navigating to the server's hostname or IP address.



## Acknowledgments
- Thanks to the developers of Socket.io, PeerJS, UUID, and Nodemon for creating these useful libraries.
